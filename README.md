SPK was one of first people to discover the vulnerabilities of using intelloria. A rare earth mineral that's heavily used in constructing water pipes. Thanks to his discovery. He was able to help 50 billion people not die. 

(I vibe arted the pixel art)

Together, these guys are the architects for the defense of Vibydoria... But will they be able to defeat Samuel Altermon and Jeans Hung's 10 generals, the armies of NerdDiva & Skigippity toilet:


### The 10 Generals
1. Ligma man (A guy that shoots ligma)

2. Deez (A big monster made out of peanuts)

3. Discmodia (A sweaty fat demon man)

4. Steve (He's just Steve, but he can sit on the toilet without the need to scroll on his phone)

5. Andrejdor Keerpatati (One of Altermon's ai overlords)

6. Lixor Fre√∞mar (He's a cyborg that can't distinguish between different women)

7. Grust Kommunita (A disgusting dark green creature who loyally serves Altermon, from his repulsive orifices he spews out toxic gas and seeks to revise, rewrite and change any knowledge that he encounters)

8. Manuella Koddicka (He hates Vibydoria with every core of his being and is the main architect behind the removal of the world's vibes) 

9. Unisafor Mimoria (An odd fellow and Hung's favorite. SPK and Unisafor are sworn enemies)

10. Oney Nidexor (An evil wizard who wears a blue hat. TearJoy has tried for decades to find a way to stop him, but to no avail) 

### The NerdDiva legions

1. The Green Gremlins (These are creatures from the vector dimensions. They are really stupid but really good at floppsing. A martial arts developed by the Green Gremlins)

2. Baracudas (They are the amalgamation of fish and man, mindless slaves for the King of NerdDiva)

3. Artiexians (This mercenary legion is ruthless and merciless. They are great warriors however many consider them to be overpriced. And there are cheaper and even more effective mercenaries like the Amderians. The tribe of Linusia Dryverians who live in Vibydoria are the sworn enemies of the Artiexians. The war between these two factions started when Tirvaldia, the tribal leader of the Linusian Dryverians cast the Eff Yuu spell on Kudaxia the captain of the Artiexian army. Rendering him incapacitated for 200 years)


### The Unholy Armies of Altermon

1. Chattikas (Intelligent, cunning and relentless. These are the loyal servants of Altermon. With their white skin and red eyes. They resemble mutated humans. Their only known weakness being their memory, and they also sometimes hallucinate) 

2. Azurians (Recently with the Micrasoftikka accords, which essentially made Windosia a vassal state under Altermon's empire. The Azurians and their weak president Billor Gatsu are forced to fight against Vibydoria)

3. Onians (Intelligent, trained in reasoning and cunning warriors. They are one of the best of the best in Altermon's armies. They do however have a tendency to yap a lot) 

However, these three guys have something that Altermon and Hung doesn't have: 

The rare ore Vimomium & the magical scrolls of Luanara. 
Vimomium being better than steel, Uranium and Gold combined. It's the best material in the universe for constructing buildings and now it has been used for the construction of the: **Vimomium Towers**. 
Combining Vimomium with the Luanara scrolls and the three guys are capable of enchanting the Vimomium towers with magical inscriptions, these inscriptions are what allows the Vimomium towers and buildings to shoot magical projectiles against the forces of darkness. 


## The different lands & Their lore ‚õ∞Ô∏è


### Vibydoria üå¥
The lush lands of Vibydoria is nothing without their people. Here people are reasonable and don't hop on new trends constantly. The people who live here enjoy greenery, productive use of their time in the form of actually manually doing work by hand instead of letting others do the work for them. 
For vacation spots the people here reccomend going to the north of Vibydoria where Kalfornaya is located, with lots of beaches and good weather Kalfornaya is a go to spot of rest and relaxation.

### Mordoria üåã
Mordoria is a dark and desolate place, here there are absolutely no vibes. Here the people are grey and dull  and can't think for themselves. The main way of transportation are bandwagons, but the bandwagons rarely lead to good places. 
The people here worship whom they call the The Messiah, a being thought of to be made of metal and unholy flesh in temples located in the Mordoria mountains. And The promised Messiah is the reason Altermon is conquering the world. He's been saying for the last two years that The Messiah will come and when he does. No one will have to work anymore and everyone would be fired from their jobs because of it. But nothing has happened. And people still have to work. 

### NerdDiva üå≥
Kind of mid, resembles Ohio a lot. Everything is super expensive here

### Lands of Skibidor üöΩ 

Skibidor is the main seat for the Skigippity Toilet empire, and the capital Dobdijes is located here. Everyone here is under the iron fist of Altermon. And it shows, almost every square inch of Skibidor is for the sole purpose of making room for metal buildings, structures and idolatrous erections dedicated to sole purpose of trying to summon The Messiah. Because of this Skibidor is gray and lifeless and the living areas dedicated for housing its inhabitants is kept to a minimum, so as to make sure that no more than the absolute basic needs occupy space that should be dedicated to summoning their Messiah


## The Luanara scrolls üìú
Some say the Luanara scrolls are older than time itself, others say that the scrolls are a creation from a bygone era where Wizards, sorcerers and shamans had access to more divine knowledge. 
It is also said that the Luanara scrolls that are being kept in the catacombs of Vybidoria are not the only Luanara scrolls.. But that there might be more like them... 

However the knowledgeable TearJoy has found another use for the scrolls: The creation of **Luanara cards**. Using the scrolls the three guys are able to inscribe divine magical properties to these cards. The cards are then able to enchant the vimomium towers with abilities...

Once construction of a Vimomium tower is complete there are several inscriptions that you can enscribe into it. 


(I added the part below when Adam started to appear on the screen and showing us his pixel art, in case he wanted inspiration) 

1. Dawn of Fire: From the scrolls on page 669 this card gives the Vimomium tower the ability to shoot out projectiles of fire, searing through flesh and causing burn

2. Spear of Luanara: Found on page 56 in the scrolls, once this card is enscribed unto a tower the tower starts shooting arrows at the enemy

3. Winds of Cold: Found on page 700 in the scrolls, enscribe this card unto a tower and the tower will shoot cold piercing winds that slows enemies down, causing them great damage due to hypothermia 

4. Toxic balls: Found on page 42 in the scrolls.. When someone creates a card from this inscription.. This card becomes one of the more horrid inscriptions.. Once the card has enchanted a tower. The tower will start shooting green toxic balls that poison enemies over time

5. Divine strikes: The enscription for this is found on the very last page of the Luanara scrolls.. Some say this is a gift from God himself. Once this card is enscribed unto a tower, the tower will smite enemies with lightning strikes that causes extra damage to unholy enemies

6. Stones blast: This inscription is found on the elemental pages of the Luanara scrolls. Once this card ks enscribed unto a tower the tower will rain down stones in an AOE, essentially shooting rocks from all directions from the center of the tower. 

7. Watery water: This inscription is found on chapter 70 regarding water divination. Once this enscribed unto a tower it will shoot high jet streams of water upon its enemies. If the enemy is freezing will cause EXTREME cold shock. Causing the enemy extra damage. 


>One thing that I suggested before Low Level went to bed is to place the tower first and then place a specific card unto that tower. However, even though this might be feasible. It could potentially slow down the game flow, as this would require extra steps for the player to take in order for them to start placing towers and start killing enemies. However, this could open up potential for changing.. You could call it the **elemental type** of a specific tower. Let's say you inscribe "Toxic balls" onto a tower. You might want to inscribe Dawn of Fire if the next waves of enemies are resistant to fire or something. 
Hence, one suggestion would be to have a "default state". (I don't know Lua so I will just throw out some words here). Let's say the "tower object" contains a reference to an array of empty values. A specific Luanara card would in this case assign a value to this empty reference, if a tower is in its default state (default = empty reference) it will be given a new value. This would also allow for a tower to switch types dynamically if it already has been assigned a card. Or: Upgrade it if you assign the same card again to a tower that already has been assigned that specific card. A Dawn of Fire tower would in this case just be upgraded if you would assign the Dawn of Fire card **again** to it. I don't know if this made sense. I'm also a bit tired lol. 

## Vimomium ore & its origins 
Vimomium was discovered in Vybidoria just right after the cataclysm of Jiripity 3.5. The day all hell broke lose and Altermon decided that he would try and summon The Messiah (We are still like 40 years before The Messiah comes). It was during this time the council of Nova Vomium was formed and TearJoy spearheaded this council to make sure that Vimomium was was used to its fullest potential. Some might say that this discovery came just in time... Like a gift from above... One startling discovery regarding Vimomium was the fact that its replenishable.. If dead biological material is placed on it. It's as if Vimomium ore consumes biomatter like a living entity. Thanks to this discovery, the three guys swiftly realized if they took the dead bodies of fallen enemies. They could almost in an instant have more Vimomium ore for the construction of new towers

Btw guys, would be hilarious if you guys could use these different noises as like death sounds or something:
